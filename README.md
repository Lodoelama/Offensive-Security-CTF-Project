# Offensive Security CTF Project

Welcome to the Offensive Security CTF Project! This repository contains concise write-ups of Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges conducted on a hypothetical company, Rekall Corporation. The challenges focus on three main areas: Web Security, Linux Servers, and Windows Servers.

## [Web Application Security CTF](https://github.com/Lodoelama/Web-Application-CTF/blob/main/README.md)

In this challenge, we identified and exploited vulnerabilities in Rekall's web application. These included Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), SQL Injection, and Local File Inclusion. One example involved exploiting an advanced XSS vulnerability on the Memory-Planner.php webpage by using a split script tag, allowing the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the user's browser.

## Linux Servers CTF

This challenge involved identifying and exploiting a range of vulnerabilities on Linux servers. These included Command Injection, Brute Force Attacks, and a Remote Code Execution vulnerability in Apache Tomcat (CVE-2017-12617). A notable instance was when we exploited a sudo vulnerability (CVE-2019-14287) for privilege escalation.

## Windows Servers CTF

In this challenge, we exploited a variety of vulnerabilities on Windows servers. These included Sensitive Data Exposure, Cached Credential vulnerabilities, and a Remote Code Execution vulnerability in SLMail service. One notable achievement was exploiting a Cached Credential vulnerability to impersonate a high-privileged user and gain unauthorized access to sensitive data.

These write-ups provide a brief overview of the CTF challenges. For a more detailed walkthrough, please refer to the *[full report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RoF1Y571b9bzMwUkaUMYnkZdCBBbZWLw7XP_xnJ5ZFQ/edit#heading=h.664pxxk2abue).* This project serves as a valuable resource for understanding potential security risks and how to address them.

# Feedback 
"Hey Lodoe, Really nice job on this Project 2! I know it's a really long one and even though you guys had the solution I wanted to see the screenshots and know that you went in and did the work. You might have one of the best submissions in class so really good job! Thanks, Milind"
